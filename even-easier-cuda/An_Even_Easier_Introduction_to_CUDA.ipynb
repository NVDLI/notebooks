I wrote a previous [“Easy Introduction”](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/easy-introduction-cuda-c-and-c/) to CUDA in 2013 that has been very popular over the years.

CUDA provides `gridDim.x`, which contains the number of blocks in the grid, and `blockIdx.x`, which contains the index of the current thread block in the grid. Figure 1 illustrates the the approach to indexing into an array (one-dimensional) in CUDA using `blockDim.x`, `gridDim.x`, and `threadIdx.x`. The idea is that each thread gets its index by computing the offset to the beginning of its block (the block index times the block size: `blockIdx.x * blockDim.x`) and adding the thread’s index within the block (`threadIdx.x`). The code `blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x` is idiomatic CUDA."
