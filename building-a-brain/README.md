This notebook explores the biological and psychological inspirations to the world's first neural networks. It can be run directly in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/NVDLI/notebooks/blob/master/building-a-brain/BuildingABrian.ipynb" target="_blank">Google Colaboratory</a>.

## Learning Objectives

The goals of this exercise include:
- Exploring how nueral networks use data to learn
- Understanding the math behind a neuron

## Prerequisites

Anyone can run the code to see how it works, but to get the most out of this content, we recommend:
- An understanding of fundamental programming concepts in [Python 3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) such as functions, loops, dictionaries, and arrays.
- An understanding of how to compute a [regression line](http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/linreg.htm).
