# Speed Up DataFrame Operations with cuDF

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NVDLI/notebooks/blob/master/cudf-speed-up/cuDF_speed_up.ipynb)

This notebook demonstrates significant speed up by moving common DataFrame operations to the GPU with minimal changes to existing code and can be run on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NVDLI/notebooks/blob/master/cudf-speed-up/cuDF_speed_up.ipynb).

## Learning Objectives

In this notebook you will

- Explore common data preparation processes using a GPU
- Compare data manipulation performance using GPU vs. CPU

## Prerequisites

Anyone can run the code to see how it works, but to get the most out of this content, we recommend:

- An understanding of fundamental programming concepts in [Python 3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) such as functions, loops, dictionaries, and arrays.
- Some experience manipulating data using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrames.
